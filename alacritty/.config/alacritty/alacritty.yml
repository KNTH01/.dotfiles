# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  TERM: xterm-256color
#
# This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
# each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
# check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
# available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled

  # spacing.
  offset:

#     args: ["Hello, World!"]
#
#command: None
# Background opacity
#
# Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
